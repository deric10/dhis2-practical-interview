Weather App with vue js 
From the application i have design form that is simple and easy to interact with,
from API'S request i have used Axios (a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser.) to handle API calls and providing appropiate response to user of app and showing loading indicator if the respond is not yet returned.
Project is decomposed to Components, Utils and view for easy management and maintainance
I have gitIgnore .env file for security concern and privacy.
Lastly, I have utilizing the localstorage to speed up performance and experience to the user by saving their data locally for later use.
